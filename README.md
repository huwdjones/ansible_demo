# Overview

# Install Anaconda

AnacondaÂ® is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python
distribution, and a collection of over 1,000+ open source
packages. I used the Miniconda version of it as a reliable clean
environment within which to set up Ansible.

This downloads a shell script wizard from which you can set up the
Miniconda environment manager.
